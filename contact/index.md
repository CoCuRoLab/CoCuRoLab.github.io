## Prospective graduate/post graduate students:
We are only admitting graduate students and postdocs through University of Sydney.

Those interested in joining our [group](../team/index.md) are expected to have strong competency is programming, optimization, systems and control theory, kinematics and dynamics of robotic systems, and rigorous mathematical theory and proof writing. Candidates should have a strong curiosity and drive to develop algorithms to expand the capabilities of robots, analyze their performance, and prove reliability through mathematical rigor and repeated experimentation. 

Other useful skills: 

- ROS 1/2 or LCM experience 
- Extensive Python and C/C++ coding experience
- Exposure to modern ML/AI autodiff libraries like JAX/PyTorch
- Proof writing abilities

If this research sounds exciting then please fill out the following [form](https://forms.gle/PR5573FpCzZ3s2WDA) and detail how you would contribute to the CoCuRo Lab.

All others inquiries about our research, mission, news outreach, etc., should email [Ian Abraham](../members/ian-abraham) at {first name} dot {last name} @sydney.edu.au .

<!-- We are always looking for qualified candidates who are interested in algorithmic and mathematical development for advancing learning and control of dynamic robotic systems. The work will touch a variety of areas in robotics including vision-based learning, optimal control, reinforcement learning, multi-agent coordination, search and exploration, locomotion, and manipulation. -->

<!-- Candidates will be expected to develop mathematical theory, be well-versed in mathematical proof writing, proficiency in coding languages and environments used in robotics such as C++/C, python, ROS, Linux (Ubuntu) shell scripting, VIM/EMACs, and have excellent speaking and writing proficiencies in English. In addition, candidates will be expected to write journal/conference papers and be able to clearly explain their research and present their work at international conferences.  -->

<!-- Research areas include:

- Active learning and optimal control 
- Multi-agent search, exploration, and coordination
- Data and Compute efficient learning for distributed complex robotics
- Representations for improving control and learning -->

<!-- Please email Prof. Ian Abraham email: ian.abraham@yale.edu with a CV, a paragrah as to why you would like to join the lab and a list of relevant publications (if any–optional). For prospective PhD students, please do not forget to apply to the Yale Mechanical Engineering department PhD program and to select Ian Abraham as a potential advisor.  -->
