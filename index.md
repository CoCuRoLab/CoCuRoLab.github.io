## About Us

The **<u>Co</u>**mputational methods for **<u>Cu</u>**rious **<u>Ro</u>**bots Lab is a robotics research group focused on the development of rigorous mathematical, algorithmic, and optimization methods for robotic learning and control led by [Dr. Ian Abraham](members/ian-abraham). 

Our research breakthroughs are deployed on a wide range of diverse robotic systems to expand their utility and overall success in the most extreme and remote environments. Check out our ongoing projects below! 

## Ongoing Projects

## Interested in [Joining](contact)?

Those interested in joining our [group](team/index.md) are expected to have strong competency is programming, optimization, systems and control theory, kinematics and dynamics of robotic systems, and rigorous mathematical theory and proof writing. Candidates should have a strong curiosity and drive to develop algorithms to expand the capabilities of robots, analyze their performance, and prove reliability through mathematical rigor and repeated experimentation. 

Other useful skills: 

- ROS 1/2 or LCM experience 
- Extensive Python and C/C++ coding experience
- Exposure to modern ML/AI autodiff libraries like JAX/PyTorch
- Proof writing abilities
